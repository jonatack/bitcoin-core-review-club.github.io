### A weekly review club for Bitcoin Core PRs

<span class="question">What is this?</span> &nbsp;A weekly club for reviewing
Bitcoin Core PRs at **{{ site.meeting_time }} on {{ site.meeting_day }}s** on IRC.

<span class="question">What's it for?</span> &nbsp;To help newer contributors
learn about the Bitcoin Core review process. The review club is *not* primarily
intended to help open PRs get merged (although that might be a nice
side-effect).

<span class="question">Who should take part?</span> &nbsp;Anyone who wants to
learn about contributing to Bitcoin Core. All are welcome to come and ask
questions!

<span class="question">What's the benefit for participants?</span>
&nbsp;Reviewing and testing PRs is the best way to start contributing to Bitcoin
Core, but it's difficult to know where to start. There are hundreds of open PRs,
many require a lot of contextual knowledge, and contributors and reviewers often
use unfamiliar terminology. The review club will give you the tools and
knowledge you need in order to take part in the [Bitcoin Core review
process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
on GitHub.

<span class="question">How do I take part?</span>

1. Clone the [Bitcoin repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), check out
   and build the PR branch, and run all tests.
2. Review the code changes and read the comments on the PR.
3. Make a note of any questions you want to ask.
4. Join the {{ site.meeting_location }} at **{{ site.meeting_time }} on {{ site.meeting_day }}**.

<span class="question">Who runs this?</span> &nbsp;Bitcoin Core contributor
[jnewbery](https://github.com/jnewbery) started the review club and schedules
the upcoming meetings. Individual meetings are hosted by a variety of Bitcoin
Core contributors. See some of our [previous hosts](/meetings-hosts/).
