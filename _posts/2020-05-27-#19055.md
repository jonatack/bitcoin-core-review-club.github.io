## Notes

- PR history:
  - The idea to use Muhash in Bitcoin Core was initially introduced by [Pieter
    Wuille](https://github.com/sipa) in this [mailing list
    post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html)
    from 2017.
  - Pieter proposed an implementation in
    [PR #10434](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10434), which still
    comprises most of the code in this week's PR.
  - I then picked up the proposal and made further research in 2019. A snapshot
    of the work can be seen in [this
    gist](https://gist.github.com/fjahr/fa4892874b090d3a4f4fccc5bafa0210).
  - Based on further insights and feedback, the idea evolved into implementing
    an index for all coin statistics and not only for the hash of the UTXO
    set. This was implemented in
    [PR #18000](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18000).
  - This week's PR is the first in a series of PRs to incrementally implement
    PR #18000.
- The PR modifies how the hash of the UTXO set is calculated. That hash, as well
  as other coin statistics, can be accessed through the `gettxoutsetinfo`
  RPC. It uses the [Muhash
  algorithm](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/inchash.pdf) which allows for
  incremental hashing.
- The truncated hash [SHA512/256](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/548.pdf) is used
  to prepare data for use in Muhash.

## Questions

1. What does "incremental hashing" mean? Which of its properties are interesting
   for our use case?
2. What were the use cases for RPC `gettxoutsetinfo` described in the resource
   links? Can you think of others? Which use cases are the most relevant to you?
3. What do you think could be the biggest downside to introducing Muhash for the
   UTXO set hash?
4. This PR not only adds Muhash but also `TruncatedSHA256Writer`. Why?
5. Why is the Muhash class implemented in Bitcoin Core and not in
   [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1)?
6. Did you look into the other proposed hashing algorithms in some of the
   resources? What were their drawbacks? Do you think Muhash is the right
   choice?
7. What are your thoughts on the Muhash benchmarks, e.g. (a) the benchmarking
   code, and (b) your observations if you tested the code locally?
8. Considering the trade-offs, should the old hashing algorithm be kept around
   and accessible (using a flag, for example)?
